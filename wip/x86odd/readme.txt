this is Corkami x86 oddities files corpus:
a set of handmade files showing various x86/x64 oddities, under Windows XP and 7.


All these files are clean and working.
However, they are hand-made and push the PE file format to its limits,
so they might be detected as malicious or as corrupted files.

check bin\test*.txt for the descriptions of each binary
Please refer to http://x86.corkami.com for explanations.
