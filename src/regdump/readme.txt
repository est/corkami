This is a small registers dumper, that dumps initial values of all general registers on specific points:
 * TLS
 * EntryPoint
 * DLL TLS (not working under XP for unknown reason)
 * DLL EntryPoint

and also special registers' values, such as: 
 * selectors
 * l/g/idt
 * Task register
 * cr0

Just run, it will output it to console.

I share the values I have at http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/InitialValues

Feel free to contribute,
