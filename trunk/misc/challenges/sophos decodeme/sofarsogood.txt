The DECODEME fashion test

Solve the cryptogram below. (Hint: it's marketing waffle proclaiming the alleged environmental friendliness of a particular technology.) Work out which Australian company it refers to, and find the first two digits of that company's ABN. Add the digits together to get a number. Write down the letter at that position in the alphabet.

Wear your DecoDeme shirt, bring evidence that you have solved the puzzle – in the form of the abovementioned letter – and attend my talk. Prince Room, closing session, final day – Friday 09 July 2010.

You will be in line to win the 1/16th-scale remote controlled tank!

Don't forget to watch Paul Ducklin's blog for hints. You can also follow Duck and the puzzle on Twitter. Look for the hashtag #decodeme. The puzzle is similar to the one we ran at AusCERT 2010, so you may pick up some hints from last time.

Of course, you can also stop by the Sophos QUESTnet stand whenever you like to ask for advice. You never know – you might catch one of us in an unguarded moment.
