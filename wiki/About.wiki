#summary About the Corkami project
#labels Featured
Corkami is:
 * *technical*
  * based on findings on real hardware
  * confirmed with many !PoCs
 * *free*
  * to browse (no annoying layout, no ads, ...)
  * to download (no login required)
  * to test (pre-compiled !PoCs included)
  * to modify (BSD Licence, complete sources included, even for pictures and documents, using open-source tools)
 * *useful*
  * constantly updated (wiki format)
   * always public, thus subject to feedback: correction, suggestion, etc...
  * binaries are directly downloadable
  * binaries are hand made to be concise
  * printable documents (cheat sheets, diagrams, tables) to use daily at work

the way I work:
 # I study a specific topic (PDF, PE, x86...)
 # when I learn something new, I code a small PoC that just focuses on this specific point
 # when I have enough !PoCs, I write a *wiki page* for it (but my !PoCs are the most up to date part, so be sure to check the nightly builds!)
 # everything is public, thus commented, corrected, noticed by the community
 # when my coverage of the topic is good enough, I apply to *present* in a conference.

Hope you like it,

== from 2013 to 2014 ==
 * 2013 was quite intensive:
  * 5 distinct materials and 8 presentations.
  * 1 new poster and 6 different versions.
  * 3 articles
  * more polyglots, more schizophrenics, more formats.
 * getting some recognition: first poster request, first custom binary requests...
 * plan for 2014: less traveling (strict minimum?), more work at home.

== step ? (2013) ==
 * starting early, presenting on puzzles at Hackpra in January.
 * 'back to France' - will apply to present at HES, SSTIC, HiP - pour essayer de se reconnecter au pays ;)
 * more graphs, more topics, more !PoCs. same old. my usual style ;)

== step 1.6 (2012/12/31) ==
 * 2012 is soon over, it was a great year:
  * Reworked the [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/BerlinSidesX2 BerlinSides] page to integrate the notes and screencasts. Nice all-in-one layout, but I now prefer the double deck (see below)
  * improved the [PE PE] page with many examples, animations and screencasts.
  * [OpcodesTables Opcodes' tables] for Android/JVM/.NET/x86.
  * the [PE101 PE 101] poster, first in 32b then in 64b, in 9 languages, including Arabic and Japanese, and then later in a lighter 'xkcd' version.
  * [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/detail?name=CorkaMIX.zip CorkaMIX], my all-in-one PDF/Java/HTML/... file in a PE, followed by its Linux counterpart, [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/detail?name=CorkaMInuX.zip CorkaMInuX].
  * the [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/PDFTricks?wl=en PDF] page also got some improvments.
  * the [InitialValues initial values] got also a huge update.
 * Presentations on PE at [HackInParis2012 Hack in Paris] then [hashdays2012 Hashdays], which introduced a dual slide-deck release, which should be my standard from now on.
 * met a lot of nice people - thanks a lot everybody for 2012!

== step 1.5 (2011/12/30) ==
 * Thanks to Candid Wüest and FX for pushing me (I initially didn't plan that at all, in both cases), I presented at [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/hashdays2011 Hashdays] and [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/BerlinSidesX2 BerlinSides].
  * Both were great experiences, and as things went not too wrong, I had a good time, while being able to express myself freely, and experimenting on making presentations.
  * I spend maybe too much time on them, but I have my own personal style now, and I'll definitely reiterate the experience next year.

This unplanned extra step makes this year 2011 even better. It was great altogether!
== step 1 (2011/10/14) ==
 * the basics are now covered: [x86oddities x86] and [PE].
 * the style of publication reached a suitable form:
  * wiki pages with proof of concepts, and quoted snippets of code ([PE], [x86oddities x86] [PDFTricks PDF])
  * pdf made from svg ([http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/list?q=pdf cheat sheets])
  * screencasts, with Wink ([http://rejava.sourceforge.net/hello.html reJava] [https://sites.google.com/site/corkami/ollydbg-tracing OllyDbg tracing])

so Corkami can step up and move on to the next level, following the same methods but tackling more advanced topics such as malware/packer analysis.
