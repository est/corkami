#summary About the Corkami project
#labels Featured
Corkami is:
 * *technical*
  * based on findings on real hardware
  * confirmed with !PoCs
 * *free*
  * to browse (no annoying layout, no ads, ...)
  * to download (no login required)
  * to test (pre-compiled proof of concepts included)
  * to modify (BSD Licence, complete sources included, even for pictures and documents, using open-source tools)
 * *useful*
  * constantly updated (wiki format)
   * always public, thus subject to feedback: correction, suggestion, etc...
  * binaries are directly downloadable
  * binaries are hand made to be concise
  * printable documents (cheat sheets, diagrams, tables) to use daily at work

the way I work:
 # I study a specific topic (PDF, PE, x86...)
 # when I learn something new, I code a small PoC that just focuses on this specific point
 # when I have enough !PoCs, I write a *wiki page* for it (but my !PoCs are the most up to date part, so be sure to check the nightly builds!)
 # everything is public, thus commented, corrected, noticed by the community
 # when my coverage of the topic is good enough, I apply to *present* in a conference.

Hope you like it,

Ange

== step 1.5 (2011/12/30) ==
 * Thanks to Candid Wüest and FX for pushing me (I initially didn't plan that at all, in both cases), I presented at [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/hashdays2011 Hashdays] and [http://code.google.com/p/corkami/wiki/BerlinSidesX2 BerlinSides].
  * Both were great experiences, and as things went not too wrong, I had a good time, while being able to express myself freely, and experimenting on making presentations.
  * I spend maybe too much time on them, but I have my own personal style now, and I'll definitely reiterate the experience next year.

This unplanned extra step makes this year 2011 even better. It was great altogether!
== step 1 (2011/10/14) ==
 * the basics are now covered: [x86oddities x86] and [PE].
 * the style of publication reached a suitable form:
  * wiki pages with proof of concepts, and quoted snippets of code ([PE], [x86oddities x86] [PDFTricks PDF])
  * pdf made from svg ([http://code.google.com/p/corkami/downloads/list?q=pdf cheat sheets])
  * screencasts, with Wink ([http://rejava.sourceforge.net/hello.html reJava] [https://sites.google.com/site/corkami/ollydbg-tracing OllyDbg tracing])

so Corkami can step up and move on to the next level, following the same methods but tackling more advanced topics such as malware/packer analysis.
