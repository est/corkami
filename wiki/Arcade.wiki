#summary Preserving arcade games

*Preserving arcade games* was presented in various locations (Recon, T2, Area41, !NuitDuHack, !RaumZeitLabor, CCC)

The slide deck initially started as pure b&w text then evolved to pictures-only, and lastly fully animated with custom recorded lossless videos (presented via tweaks of [http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/menu-readme.html AdvanceMenu]). It now weights around 1Gb.

The best version was presented at the CCC
