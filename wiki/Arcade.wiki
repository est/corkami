#summary Preserving arcade games

*Preserving arcade games* was presented at Recon, T2, Area41, !NuitDuHack, !RaumZeitLabor, CCC and other locations.

=Abstract=
_Old-school arcade games were so protected that hacking is the only way to preserve them before all boards are dead, and the games are lost._

 * an overview of famous old-school arcade games
 * their incredible hardware
 * the permanent piracy
 * the awesome protections (designed to commit suicide !)
 * what was required to preserve some of them from being lost for ever.

This talk is a homage to Michael Steil's Ultimate Commodore 64 presentation at 25c3: you should watch it, it's inspiring in content and quality !

=Contents= 
The slide deck initially started as pure b&w text, then evolved to pictures only, and lastly fully animated with custom recorded (some are tools-assisted) lossless videos, presented via a tweaked version of [http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/menu-readme.html AdvanceMenu] (an arcade frontend) (_full deck download soon_)

Why? This talk was rejected a lot - often without even an answer despite requests - so I just kept improving it anyway :)

The best version was presented at the CCC ([http://media.ccc.de/browse/congress/2014/31c3_-_5997_-_en_-_saal_6_-_201412282030_-_preserving_arcade_games_-_ange_albertini.html hi-res download]) ([http://events.ccc.de/congress/2014/Fahrplan/events/5997.html event page, with feedback link])

Thanks to everyone who could make this presentation possible, and to anyone who made preservation possible, and in particular CPS2.
