===Frequently Given Answers===
 * relocations, dynamically linked executable, and segment/section (program/section headers) are planned for another poster.
 * these posters are hand-made with Inkscape.
 * they use _Envy Code R_ (code, hex) and _Ubuntu Monospace_ (elf execution) fonts. The fun one also uses _Aracne Regular_ (text) and _Just the way you are_ (title), and the professional one _Arial Unicode MS_ (which covers a lot of language).
 * future planned releases: x64, ARM
